Finally we submitted the code after aligning the code.

Actually the filliong of the pipeline takes place after the execution. 
But we changed it in such a way that it happens during execution of each instruction. 
We tried to print the Number of Instructions and checked the  IPC values.

We added printval function to calculate IPC, Number of stalls , Number of clock cycles and prints it.
We added latencies as a parameter to the run and execute functions.

We added only few instructions in the pipeline function , we added few more  instructions like mv,blt ..
We decided to implement the latencies as a Map.
But we didnot try to implement it bcz we didn't  complete much so we decided to do it at the last.

NOTE: About the hazards we only tried to check the destination register of the current instruction and if it is the same as the previous one , we assumed it as  a hazard.

We thought of filling the pipeline after the implementation of the execute function.  

Date: 03-03-2024
Members: Greeshma, Snehitha
Wea dded a funtion to fill the pipeline.
We also added a function Hazard which returns the destination register.

Members: Greeshma, Snehitha
We decided to implement the pipeline as a 2D array.
We thought of starting it on the next day as we have submissions(Sad Life).

Discussion on implementing the pipeline logic , searched for the similar repositories in the github.
We didn't have any about implementing Latencies.

Now after doing it and fixing some bugs present in code both worked properly ...

Members: Greeshma , Snehitha
So we gave first 6 values in the memory to selection sort and next 3 to the bubble sort.

 Date: 23-02-2024
 Members: Greeshma , Snehitha
 both the codes worked individually.When we tried to combine the code they didn't work we understood that both the files are accessing the same memory locations 
 so we tried to fix the assembly code.

 Finally fixed the bubble sort 
 it gave the right ouput but the selection sort didn.t work properly.modified the code for selection sort, it worked

 Date: 20-02-2024
 Members: Greeshma , Snehitha
 corrected the assembly code passed both the files , but both the files gave the wrong output. 
 So tried fixing bubble sort 

 Date: 18-02-2024
 Members: Greeshma , Snehitha
 Found that the assembly code for selection sort is incorrect , struggled a lot to correct it.

 Date: 17-02-2024
 Members: Greeshma , Snehitha
 created two cores and changed the code accordingly and tried to pass bothe files also written assembly code for selection sort

 Date: 16-02-2024
 Members: Greeshma , Snehitha
 Wrote the code for instructions li,lw,sw,add in execute function and committed the code into github

 Date: 15-02-2024
 Members: Greeshma , Snehitha
 Written the assembly code for bubble sort  and passed the file

 Date: 13-02-2024
 Members: Greeshma , Snehitha
 Looked at the code explained in the lab and tried to convert it into c++ and noted down the pseudo code which has to be written.
 Started with core class

 Spoke to a senior regarding the project and looked at their code to get an idea of what has to be done.

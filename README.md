 Spoke to a senior regarding the project and looked at their code to get an idea of what has to be done.

 Looked at the code explained in the lab and tried to convert it into c++ and noted down the pseudo code which has to be written.
 Started with core class

  Found that the assembly code for selection sort is incorrect , struggled a lot to correct it.

  both the codes worked individually.When we tried to combine the code they didn't work we understood that both the files are accessing the same memory locations 
  so we tried to fix the assembly code.

  So we gave first 6 values in the memory to selection sort and next 3 to the bubble sort.

  Now after doing it and fixing some bugs present in code both worked properly ...
